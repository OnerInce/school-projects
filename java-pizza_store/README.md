# java-pizza_store

Pizza store simulation in Java language. Customer.txt has customer data as input and simulation processes with input.txt and order.txt input files while updating customer.txt file meantime. Using interfaces and abstract classes, so every pizza type and topping has its own class. This way, it is so much easier to add new type or topping.
