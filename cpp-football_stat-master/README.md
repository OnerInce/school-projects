# cpp-football_stat

This C++ program reads a football stats database with using linked list data structure(both singly and doubly) which has goal stats (scorer, teams, minute) and provides some specific results such as:

1. The period in which the most goals are scored in the league (0-45 minutes in the first half,
46-90 minutes in the second half). If the first half, print 0. Otherwise, print 1.
2. Find the top goal scorer and print his name on the screen. There is no player who scored his
own goal. (There may be more than one footballer with the same goal count, in this case
all should be printed.)
3. To print the names of footballers who scored hat-trick. (Hat-trick is the scoring of three and
more goals in a game by one player)
4. Print the team list in the league
5. Print the list of footballers
6. Matches and goals of given footballer
